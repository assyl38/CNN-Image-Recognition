# CNN-Image-Recognition
## Inroduction
The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks. CNNs represent a huge breakthrough in image recognition. They’re most commonly used to analyze visual imagery and are frequently working behind the scenes in image classification. They can be found at the core of everything from Facebook’s photo tagging to self-driving cars. They’re working hard behind the scenes in everything from healthcare to security.

## How does it work?
Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “cat”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a cat”). You can look at a picture and know that you’re looking at a terrible shot of your own face, but how can a computer learn to do that?
With a convolutional neural network!
A CNN has: </br>
- Convolutional layers</br>
- ReLU layers </br>
- Pooling layers </br>
- a Fully connected layer </br>

A classic CNN architecture would look something like this: </br>

In this example we'll build a neural network using the CIFAR-10 dataset
